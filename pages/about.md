# About WaysToHelp.eu

This website has been created during a two-days long hackathon "Riga TechGirls".

Right now the website is work-in-progress, so please be gentle. We're more than happy to get feedback, comments and suggestions to improve.

Right now the best way to contact us is through [Github Issues](https://github.com/WaysToHelp/waystohelp.github.io/issues). You're also welcome to send us pull-requests :)
